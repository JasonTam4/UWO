    "## General comments \n",
    "This Midterm integrates knowledge and skills acquired in the first half of the semester, especially in first 6 Assignments. You are allowed to use any document and source on your computer and look up documents on the internet. **You or not allowed to share documents, or communicate in any other way with people inside or outside the class room during the midterm. You are not allowed to use ChatGPT, co-pilot or any other similar AI - so if you IDE has a copilot plugin, disable it. If you get caught with the plugin enabled, it will be reported as academic dishonesty.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit the midterm by the due date (12:20) on OWL under Gradescope/Midterm_OpenBook. Late submission will be scored with 0 pts, unless you have received extra accommodation. So please start your submission five minutes before the deadline!  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Guidance\n",
    "The midterm is supposed to be challenging (especially Question 9). If you get stuck on a particular question because you can't solve a programming problem, just write down in text *how* you would try to solve the problem - if correct this can give you partial points. Then continue the other parts of the question, the next question, or next task. The midterm is designed, such that the solutions do not require that the previous question is solved correctly. \n",
    "If you need the solution from a previous problem, just *assume* some outcome and answer the question under that assumption. If you do this, make your assumptions explicit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read all the questions carefully. Most questions demands a written answer as part of it. These need to be spelled out in a whole English sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "To finish the midterm in the alloted time, you will have to work fast and efficiently. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "## General grading criteria \n",
    "- The code must be working - if you are instructed to test the function, the output needs to the shown. \n",
    "- Results should be reported in understandable sentences. \n",
    "- Results should be reported rounded to a reasonable number of decimals\n",
    "- x and y axes should be labeled in plots.\n",
    "- Each Figure should have a text caption that explains what is displayed in the Figure (type of plot, x,y, grouping variables)\n",

The authors used  caffeine intake as a blocking variable during the random assignment.\n",

In this task, they had to read sentences presented in the middle of the screen and at the same time detect the presence small targets in the visual periphery, but ignore distractors.
