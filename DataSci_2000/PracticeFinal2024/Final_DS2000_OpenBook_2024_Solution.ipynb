    "## Problem description \n",
    "\n",
    "About 1\\% of the population will be diagnosed with schizophrenia at some point in their life, usually at the age of 17-22years, with devastating consequences for the individual and their family. If we could use brain imaging and a mathematical model to predict who will develop schizophrenia, we could intervene early and potentially prevent the onset of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "One brain structure that has been associated with schizophrenia is the cerebellum. The cerebellum consists of regions that are involved in motor control and in cognitive functions. The dataset for the final contains the volume of these two part of the cerebellum in 200 individuals. The individuals for this studied were sampled from a cohort of individuals with a family history of schizophrenia, and thus have a much higher risk of schizophrenia than the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ages at which the brain scans were taken varies from 5-17 (before the potential onset of the disease). The brain still undergoes considerable growth during this period. We can determine whether a child is developing normal by comparing the volumes to sex and age matched norms. In this final you will build such a normative model, and then use it to predict the risk of schizophrenia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is provided in the file `brain_volumes.csv`. The file contains the following the following columns:\n",
    "- `age`: the age of the individual in years\n",
    "- `sex`: the biological sex of the individual (either `male` or `female`)\n",
    "- `income`: the income of individual's family (Socioeconomic status) (either `low`, `middle`, or `high`)\n",
    "- `schizophrenia`: a binary variable indicating whether the individual developed schizophrenia (1) or not (0)\n",
    "- `vol_motor`: the volume of the motor regions of the cerebellum in cm^3\n",
    "- `vol_cognitive`: the volume of the cognitive regions of the cerebellum in cm^3\n",
    "- `z_motor`: the z-score of the motor regions' volume (relative to the normal population)\n",
